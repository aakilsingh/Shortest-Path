# Problem
Write a method, shortestPath, that takes in a list of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). The method should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. If there is no path between A and B, then return -1. You can assume that A and B exist as nodes in the graph.
